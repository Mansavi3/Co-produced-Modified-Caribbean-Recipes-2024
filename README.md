# Co-produced-Modified-Caribbean-Recipes-2024
We are a team of nutrition academics, Dr Tanefa Apekey (Registered Nutritionist) and Dr Sally Moore (Registered Dietitian & Nutritionist), who are responding to the need for nutrition professionals to access evidence-based culturally appropriate healthy eating and recipe resources to guide food choice with people from certain ethnic groups, including people from African and Caribbean backgrounds. To do this, we have worked in partnership with people from the relevant ethnic groups and a community partner based in Leeds Chapeltown, to co-design and test healthier recipes featuring African and Caribbean traditional dishes. **The project was funded by Heart Research UK and LeedsACT Seedcorn funding
