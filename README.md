# Co-produced-Modified-Caribbean-Recipes-2024
The recipes were prepared with a Third Sector Organisation and their African Caribbean services-users. Standard recipes were modified by Registered Nutritionist using a dietary analysis software then prepared by service-users in a community service kitchen. We used their feedback to refine the recipes before producing these recipes cards.
